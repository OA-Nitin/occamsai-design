                    <p class="body-text-1">Forming an LLC and opening a business bank account are essential steps to
                        protect your personal assets and streamline your finances. An LLC limits your personal liability
                        in case of legal or financial issues, while a business bank account helps you separate personal
                        and business finances, making tax preparation easier and ensuring a more professional image for
                        your business. </p>

                    <p class="body-text-1">A limited liability company is a formal business structure (created as per
                        state law) where the business is legally distinct from the owner(s). It may have a single owner
                        in the case of a Single-Member LLC or multiple owners in the case of a Multi-Member LLC.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="body-text-1">An LLC combines the perks of a corporation (protection against personal
                        liability) and a partnership (pass-through taxation). Since the business has a separate legal
                        existence, the members are not personally liable for the debts and obligations of the Company.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p class="body-text-1">State laws stipulate how LLCs should be incorporated. Some states require
                        specific documents, such as the articles of organization, membership agreement, etc., to be
                        filed with the authorities.</p>
